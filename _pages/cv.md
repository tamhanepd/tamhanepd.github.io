WORK EXPERIENCE
======
## Work Experience

### **Postdoctoral Researcher** | University of Alabama in Huntsville, USA  
*September 2023 – Present*  
- Analyzed HST ultraviolet imaging of M87 to quantify star formation rates and histories using custom Python pipelines for source extraction, image processing, and statistical modeling, identifying the weakest known starburst in a massive galaxy.  
- Contributed to successful proposals for ALMA and XRISM, and collaborated on multiwavelength observational campaigns involving HST, MUSE, and other instruments to study AGN feedback and star formation.  
- Led and supported cross-institutional research projects, mentored junior researchers, presented at international conferences, and reviewed telescope proposals and scientific manuscripts.

### **Data Scientist** | ZebraKet, Canada  
*June 2023 – August 2023*  
- Developed data cleaning and preprocessing pipelines using Python and Pandas to ensure high-quality industrial facility data.  
- Built fault detection models using machine learning and deep learning (scikit-learn, PyTorch), improving anomaly detection accuracy.  
- Performed feature engineering and statistical analysis to identify key variables influencing system performance.

### **Postdoctoral Researcher** | University of Waterloo, Canada  
*February 2023 – August 2023*  
- Simulated mock galaxy observations and analyzed data for the upcoming XRISM X-ray space telescope mission using Python.  
- Mentored two graduate students and co-authored a research paper submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.  
- Collaborated on competitive telescope time proposals with international research teams.

### **Research Assistant (PhD)** | University of Waterloo, Canada  
*May 2017 – December 2022*  
- Analyzed multi-wavelength datasets (radio, optical, X-ray) of galaxies, creating science-ready images and spectra from several terabytes of raw data.  
- Applied Bayesian inference and linear regression to study galaxy properties, contributing to multiple peer-reviewed publications.  
- Adapted research strategies to data availability constraints, demonstrating flexibility in long-term project planning.  
- Collaborated with international teams; led and co-led projects resulting in four academic papers and multiple conference presentations.

### **Teaching Assistant** | University of Waterloo, Canada  
*May 2017 – December 2022*  
- Delivered tutorials for undergraduate physics courses and provided one-on-one academic support to students.  
- Taught five laboratory courses and evaluated student performance across written assignments and exams in both in-person and virtual settings.

### **Visiting Research Student** | National Centre for Radio Astrophysics, India  
*May 2014 – May 2015*  
- Analyzed data from a newly identified galaxy; modeled its spectrum to derive key physical properties.  
- Authored a peer-reviewed publication based on this work, which received media coverage.  
- Processed and statistically analyzed large galaxy datasets to identify trends in galaxy morphology and emission.
