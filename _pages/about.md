Hello! Welcome to my homepage.

I'm a Postdoctoral researcher at the University of Waterloo in Canada with a PhD in Astronomy. My research interests lie in the realm of AGN feedback, with a specific focus on radio-mechanical feedback in galaxy clusters. I examine the impact of this feedback on central cluster galaxies, particularly its role in suppressing star formation, molecular gas formation and influencing galaxy evolution.

In addition to my academic journey, I bring valuable industry experience as a data scientist at ZebraKet. This role has equipped me with practical skills in extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets and translating them into actionable solutions. My ability to analyze diverse information sources sets me apart as a versatile thinker with a holistic perspective.

In my free time, I enjoy speding time outdoors hiking, biking, indoor/outdoor rock climbing. I also enjoy nature and bird photography.
