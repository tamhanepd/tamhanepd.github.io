Hello! Welcome to my homepage.
I am a PhD candidate in astronomy at the University of Waterloo, ON, Canada. My general research area is AGN feedback. Specifically, I am studying the relative impact of mechanical feedback in galaxy clusters compared to other types of AGN and starburst feedback in order to study its role in suppressing star formation and galaxy evolution. I use data across the electromagnetic spectrum from X-rays to radio from ground and space based telescopes to study different phases of gases and their interaction with radio jets and lobes emenating from the viscinity of the central supermassive black holes.

In my free time, I enjoy speding time outdoors hiking, biking, indoor/outdoor rock climbing.
