Hello! Welcome to my homepage.
I am a PhD candidate in astronomy at the University of Waterloo, ON, Canada. My general research area is AGN feedback. Specifically, I am studying the impact of mechanical feedback in central cluster galaxies to study its role in suppressing star formation and galaxy evolution. I use data across the electromagnetic spectrum from X-rays to radio, from ground and space based telescopes. I study the kinematics and energics of gases in various temperatures from 10 million K down to few 10s K, and their interaction with radio jets/lobes.

I am also passionate about data science, Machine Learning and AI. I am looking forward to learning new skills and applying them to solve different problems.

In my free time, I enjoy speding time outdoors hiking, biking, indoor/outdoor rock climbing. i also enjoy nature and bird photography.
