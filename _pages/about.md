Hello! Welcome to my homepage.

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, where I study how active galactic nuclei (AGN) shape their environments. My work focuses on radio-mechanical feedback in galaxy groups and clusters, particularly how it influences central galaxies, from regulating star formation to shaping the molecular gas content and overall galaxy evolution. I earned my PhD in Astronomy from the University of Waterloo in Canada.

Beyond my research, I have experience as a data scientist at ZebraKet, which has broadened my analytical perspective across different domains. I'm fascinated by the rise of AI and actively explore its applications in science and other disciplines, particularly how these tools can enhance research methodologies and data analysis.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time outdoors hiking, biking, playing volleyball and indoor/outdoor rock climbing. I'm also passionate about nature and bird photography.
