title: "Radio jet-ISM interaction and positive radio-mechanical feedback in Abell 1795"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-03-paper
excerpt: 'We studied the positive radio mechanical feedback and the interaction between radio jets and the interstellar medium in the brightest cluster galaxy of the Abell 1795 galaxy cluster. We found that radio-jet triggered star formation has a lower efficiency compared to the efficiency of star formation in the central regions of nearby spiral galaxies.'
