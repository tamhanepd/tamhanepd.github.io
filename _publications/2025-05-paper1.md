excerpt: 'We analyzed the velocity structure function (VSF), a tool for quantifying turbulence, of nebular gas in the central galaxies of four galaxy clusters using Keck Cosmic Web Imager data, and compared it to molecular gas traced by ALMA. In most systems, the extended filamentary nebular gas shows steep VSF slopes, likely influenced by gravity and AGN-driven motions. Comparisons to X-ray-derived turbulence from Chandra observations support condensation-driven gas motions in some clusters. We also highlighted challenges in comparing VSFs across wavelengths due to instrumental, projection, and resolution-related effects.'
