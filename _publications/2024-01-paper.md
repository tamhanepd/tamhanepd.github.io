title: "A massive multiphase plume of gas in Abell 2390's brightest cluster galaxy"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-01-paper
excerpt: 'We studied the origin of massive (>10^10 solar masses) molecular gas plume in Abell 2390 brightest cluster galaxy also observed in the X-ray and optical wavelengths. We discuss different mechanisms that could have led to the formation of the plume based on its observed properties. We also report detection of molecular gas absorption against the nucleus and somple models to explain its origin.'
