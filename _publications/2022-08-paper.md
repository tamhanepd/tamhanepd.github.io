collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-08-paper
excerpt: 'We studied molecular flows in brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and compared them with molecular flows in early type galaxies. Molecular flows in BCGs powered by radio-mechanical feedback are larger, heavier and slower. We found that radio feedback is generally more effective at lifting gas in galaxies compared to quasars and starburst winds. Star formation in BCGs is quenched compared to other galaxies.'
