title: "Can Active Galactic Nuclei Activity Be Enhanced by Ram Pressure Stripping?—X-Ray Perspective"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-01-paper1
excerpt: 'This study investigated the potential connection between ram pressure stripping (RPS) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity in cluster galaxies from an X-ray perspective, analyzing a sample of RPS galaxies in four nearby clusters. The results show no significant enhancement in X-ray AGN activity among RPS galaxies compared to non-RPS galaxies, suggesting that any potential effect is weak or occurs on a short timescale'
