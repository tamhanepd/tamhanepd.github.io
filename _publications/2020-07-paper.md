title: "Thermally Unstable Cooling Stimulated by Uplift: The Spoiler Clusters"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-07-paper
excerpt: 'In this paper we studied clusters with low atmospheric cooling time but no warm/cold gas. We propose that the clusters lack cold gas because their central radio jets fail to lift low-entropy gas to large altitudes.'
