title: "XRISM Reveals Low Nonthermal Pressure in the Core of the Hot, Relaxed Galaxy Cluster A2029"

excerpt: 'I co-authored one of the first publications using early data from the XRISM telescope. In this study, we analyzed the extremely massive and relaxed galaxy cluster Abell 2029, one of the XRISM Performance Verification (PV) targets. Using XRISMs high spectral resolution, we measured bulk motions in the intracluster medium below 100 km/s and a velocity dispersion of ~170 km/s. If the dispersion is due to turbulence, it implies that non-thermal pressure contributes only ~3% of the thermal pressure, confirming Abell 2029s remarkably relaxed dynamical state.'
