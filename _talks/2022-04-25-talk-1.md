I talked about our analysis of molecular gas flows in 14 brightest cluster galaxies. Comparing molecular flows in BCGs to those in other nearby AGN and starburst galaxies, we found that flows in BCGs are larger, heavier and slower. The lifting factor in BCGs is higher than other AGN indicating that the radio-mechanical feedback is more effective. It can also suppress star formation in BCGs.
