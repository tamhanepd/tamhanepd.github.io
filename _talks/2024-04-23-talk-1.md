[Astronomy on Tap](https://astronomyontap.org/) (AoT) is a popular science outreach program that brings together astronomers and space enthusiasts in an informal setting such as bars, cafes or similar venues. It happens in many cities across the world where local astronomers offer talks, discussion and presentations on various topics related to astronomy in a relaxed atmosphere in a way that's engaging and easy to understand for everyone regardless of their educational background.

I delivered a talk on Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at the AoT's Huntsville chapter. I explained what are active galactic nuclei, what fuels them, how powerful they are and why they are important for galaxy evolution. Towards the end I talked about my research focusing on the radio-mechanical AGN feedback in galaxy clusters and presented some spectacular images of radio galaxies and galaxy clusters across a spectrum of wavelengths.
