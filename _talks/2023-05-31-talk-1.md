In this conference I talked about my work on the star formation in the molecular gas filament in the central galaxy of the Abell 1795 cluster. The BCG has ~7-10 kpc long molecular gas filaments with bright UV emission indicative of star formation wrapped around radio jets emanating from the central AGN. I presented my results on the nature of the interaction between radio jets and the gas, the nature and efficieny of star formation and the role of turbulence.
