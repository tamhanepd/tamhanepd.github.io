I had the honor of speaking at the [McNamara@65](https://uwaterloo.ca/astrophysics-centre/events/mcnamara65-understanding-feedback-galaxies-and-clusters) conference at the University of Waterloo in Canada. This event celebrated the 65th birthday of my PhD supervisor, Prof. Brian McNamara, and his significant contributions to astronomy.

In my talk, I explored the fascinating role of X-ray cavities in uplifting gas from central regions, which drives molecular gas flows and cooling in active galactic nuclei (AGN). These molecular gas flows are common in many AGN and starburst galaxies, as well as in brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). While they are typically powered by quasar mode AGN feedback in most nearby galaxies, in BCGs, they are driven by mechanical feedback from radio jets. Our research shows that this mechanical feedback is significantly more efficient at driving powerful molecular flows per unit of driving power.

In the second half of my presentation, I discussed the conditions required for gas uplift, focusing on various gas cooling time thresholds. By assuming bulk linear uplift of low entropy gas from the inner regions, we determined the necessary heights and velocities for this uplift to explain the observed multiphase filaments.

Presenting my research to an expert audience and meeting many colleagues and co-authors for the first time was an incredible experience. It was a privilege to contribute to this special event in honor of Prof. McNamara.
